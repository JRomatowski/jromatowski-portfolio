- As a non-technical HR manager, I want to quickly see the skills and experience of a candidate, so that I can evaluate whether the candidate meets the requirements for an open position at my company.

- As a mid-level engineer, I want view a junior developer's project and read their code, so that I can evaluate their coding skills.

- As a friend of the person who built this portfolio, I want to see what my friend has built so that I have an understanding of what they do as a developer and I can encourage them.

### MVP Goals

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Hosted on Netlify or Github Pages.
- Commits to Github every day.
- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
The app must:
- Have the following pages:
    - home (greeting page)
    - bio (your background)
    - resume (past work experience)
    - projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build -- we'll be adding  to this as we build more applications in class)
    links (links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and other sites you find interesting)
        - optionally, instead of making this a separate page, you can make these links appear as part of a navigation section that appears on all pages
- Use JS to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens). Write these from scratch. Each point should be a different kind of interaction (i.e. don't just create 3 modals). Don't use 3rd party frameworks/libraries like jQuery UI, Bootstrap, etc.
- Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).

### Stretch Goals

CSS - Buttons light up when hovered, respond somehow when clicked
CSS? - Figure out curves and circles in the design
CSS - enhance colors away from default presets.
CSS - Give serious time to font selection, outside of default
CSS/HTML - Do flute graphics with HTML or import graphics?
figure out animations for when you click page links (if I do this)
JS - Click a button on a flute, get a sound and/or recording.

- Create a complex user interface module (e.g. a carousel, modal, sticky nav, etc)

- Create an additional browser-based game (e.g. a quiz, choose your own adventure, battle game, etc)

- Research AJAX (covered later in this course) and create an app that displays interesting data from an external source (ask your instructor for a list of good sources)
