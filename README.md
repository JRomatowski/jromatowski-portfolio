## Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website.

## User Stories

- As a non-technical HR manager, I want to quickly see the skills and experience of a candidate, so that I can evaluate whether the candidate meets the requirements for an open position at my company.
- As a mid-level engineer, I want view a junior developer's project and read their code, so that I can evaluate their coding skills.
- As a friend of the person who built this portfolio, I want to see what my friend has built so that I have an understanding of what they do as a developer and I can encourage them.

## Hurdles I Overcame

- I struggled with getting circles around the menu navigation items.  
- I struggled figuring out how to get those circles to change color when I mouseovered them.
- I unintentionally designed for the desktop version first, and then had to redo some things to make it work for phones.  This was annoying.  
- I really struggled getting my photos and text blocks to format correctly for mobile.  

## Descriptions of Unsolved Problems 

- My Contact Form doesn't work.  I followed two tutorials online unsuccessfully.  I need to make sure that stored inputs are getting saved as an object and then stored into an array.  

- My preference would be to have the "Cat" button bring up a cat gallery on the page, keeping people on the page rather than linking away from the page.  This seems complicated so I haven't started working on it.
