Have the following pages
    -home (greeting page)
    -bio (your background)
    -resume (past work experience)
    -projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build -- we'll be adding to this as we build more applications in class)
    -links (links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and other sites you find interesting)
        -optionally, instead of making this a separate page, you can make these links appear as part of a navigation section that appears on all pages
Use JS to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens).
    -Write these from scratch. Each point should be a different kind of interaction (i.e. don't just create 3 modals). Don't use 3rd party frameworks/libraries like jQuery UI, Bootstrap, etc.
Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).
A README.md file 
    -Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Hosted on Netlify or Github Pages.
