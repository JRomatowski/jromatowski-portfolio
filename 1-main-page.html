            <!-- <h2>Bio Here!</h2> -->
            <p>Joshua Romatowski, flutist, has been praised for his ability to “allow each note to sound with its own expressive qualities” (San Francisco Examiner). His playing has been described as “elegantly shaped” (San Francisco Examiner) and possessing “graceful intimacy” (San Francisco Classical Voice). Joshua was a winner of the Ladies Musical Club of Seattle Frances Walton Competition and a prize winner in the National Flute Association's Baroque Artist Competition. Joshua has appeared with American Bach Soloists in San Francisco, Portland Baroque Orchestra, the Byron Schenkman and Friends concert series in Seattle, Pacific Music Works, Seattle Baroque Orchestra, Victoria Baroque, Minnesota Bach Society, and Musikanten Montana.

            As an educator Joshua has given classes on historically informed performance at Oakland University and Pacific Lutheran University and is a founder of the period woodwind quintet Canova Winds, a woodwind quintet that performs exclusively on replicas of period instruments. Joshua currently works with a full studio of students in and around the Bellevue area, as well as weekly flute coachings within the Auburn School District.
            ​
            ​Joshua currently holds the 3rd Flute/Piccolo chair with Symphony Tacoma and is on faculty at Music Works Northwest in Bellevue. Joshua’s primary teachers have been Timothy Day(San Francisco Symphony), Marianne Gedigian(Boston Symphony), Jeffery Zook(Detroit Symphony),  and period instruments with Janet See(Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, Philharmonia Baroque).</p>
